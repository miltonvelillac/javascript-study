/**
 * Arrow functions differ from functions defined in other ways in one critical way:
 * they inherit the value of the this keyword from the environment in which they are defined rather than
 * defining their own invocation context as functions defined in other ways do. This is an important and very
 * useful feature of arrow functions, and weâ€™ll return to it again later in this chapter. Arrow functions also
 * differ from other functions in that they do not have a prototype property, which means that they can not be
 * used as constructor functions for new classes.
