/**
 * The Node.js server-side JavaScript environment is deeply asynchronous and defines many APIs that use callbacks and events. The default API for reading the contents of a file, for example, is asynchronous and invokes a callback function when the contents of the file have been read:
 */

const fs = require('fs'); // The "fs" module has filesystem-related APIs
let options = {           // An object to hold options for our program
  // default options would go here
};

// Read a configuration file, then call the callback function
fs.readFile('config.json', 'utf-8', (err, text) => {
    if (err) {
        // If there was an error, display a warning, but continue
        console.warn('Could not read config file:', err);
    } else {
        // Otherwise parse the file contents and assign to the options object
        Object.assign(options, JSON.parse(text));
    }

    // In either case, we can now start running the program
    startProgram(options);
});


/**
 * Node’s fs.readFile() function takes a two-parameter callback as its last argument. It reads the specified file asynchronously and then invokes the callback. If the file was read successfully, it passes the file contents as the second callback argument. If there was an error it passes the error as the first callback argument. In this example we express the callback as an arrow function which is a succinct and natural syntax for this kind of simple operation.
 * 
 * 
 * Node also defines a number of event-based APIs. The following function shows how to make an HTTP request for the contents of a URL in Node. It has two layers of asynchronous code handled with event listeners. Notice that Node uses an on() method to register event listeners instead of addEventListener():
 */

const https = require('https');

// Read the contents of the url as text and pass it to the callback
function getText(url, callback) {
    // Start an HTTP GET request for the URL
    request = https.get(url);

    // Register an function to handle the 'response' event.
    request.on('response', response => {
        // The response event means that response headers have been received
        let httpStatus = response.statusCode;

        // The body of the HTTP response has not been received yet.
        // So we register more event handlers to to be called when it arrives.
        response.setEncoding('utf-8');  // We're expecting Unicode text
        let body = "";                  // which we will accumulate here.

        // This event handler is called when a chunk of the body is ready
        response.on('data', chunk => { body += chunk });

        // This event handler is called when the response is complete
        response.on('end', () => {
            if (httpStatus == 200) {    // If the HTTP response was good
                callback(null, body);   // Pass response body to the callback
            } else {                    // Otherwise pass an error
                callback(httpStatus, null);
            }
        });
    });

    // We also register an event handler for errors
    request.on('error', (err) => {
        callback(err, null);
    });
}
